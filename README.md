## üê≥ Docker Installation (Recommended)

The fastest way to run Invoicerr is using Docker Compose. A prebuilt image is available at [ghcr.io/impre-visible/invoicerr](https://ghcr.io/impre-visible/invoicerr).

### üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Impre-visible/invoicerr.git
   cd invoicerr
   ```

2. Edit the `docker-compose.yml` to set your environment variables.

3. Run the app:  
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. Open your browser at:  
   ```
   http://localhost
   ```

### üèóÔ∏è Building from Source

If you want to build the Docker image locally or need custom modifications:

#### Prerequisites
- Docker with Buildx support
- Docker Bake (included with Docker Desktop)

#### Build Commands

```bash
# Local development build
docker buildx bake image-local

# Multi-platform production build (AMD64 + ARM64)
docker buildx bake image-all

# Push to registry
docker buildx bake image-push

# Security scan build
docker buildx bake security-scan
```

#### Build Targets

- **`image-local`**: Local development image with caching
- **`image-all`**: Multi-platform production build (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- **`image-push`**: Build and push to container registry
- **`security-scan`**: Build for security scanning (cache-only output)

#### Container Testing

Validate your container build with Goss:

```bash
# Install Goss (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://goss.rocks/install | sh

# Run container validation tests
goss -g tests.yaml validate --format tap

# Or test against running container
docker run -d --name test-invoicerr invoicerr:local
goss -g tests.yaml validate --format documentation
docker stop test-invoicerr && docker rm test-invoicerr
```

### üîß Environment Variables

These environment variables are defined in `docker-compose.yml` under the `invoicerr` service:

- `DATABASE_URL`  
  PostgreSQL connection string. Example:  
  `postgresql://invoicerr:invoicerr@invoicerr_db:5432/invoicerr_db`

- `APP_URL`  
  Full public URL of the frontend (e.g., `https://invoicerr.example.com`).  
  This is required for email templates and links.

- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`  
  Credentials and server used for sending emails (quotes, invoices, etc.)

- `SMTP_FROM`  
  Optional ‚Äî address used as the sender for emails. If omitted, defaults to `SMTP_USER`.

- `JWT_SECRET`  
  Optional but recommended for JWT authentication. Can be any random string.  
  If not set, a default secret will be used. But it can have issues with docker deployments.

Make sure port 80 is available on your host machine, or change the mapping.
